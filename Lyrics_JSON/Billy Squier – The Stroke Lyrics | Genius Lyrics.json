    "Comments": [
        "Like The Violent Femmes‘ Blister in the Sun, Billy Idol’s Dancing with Myself, and The Vapors’ Turning Japanese, this song’s artist stridently denies that it’s about masturbation.",
        "According to Squire, it’s about the ego stroking that goes on in the music industry.",
        "At the very least, each line is a clever double-entendre that can indeed be taken that way.",
        "Since Squire was already a 12 year veteran recording artist when this song became his first hit, it’s entirely reasonable that he was taking aim at the industry."
